产品破局

业务解释：代表了应用模型的价值体现

预测前后的业务解释很重要

The general procedure for making labels is:
* Define the business requirement: predict customers who will churn during a specified period of time
* Translate the business requirement into a machine learning problem: given historical customer data, build a model to predict which customers will churn depending on several parameters
* Make labels along with cutoff times corresponding to the machine learning problem: develop functions that take in parameters so the same function can be used for multiple prediction problems.
* Label all past historical data: parallelize operations by partitioning data into independent subsets
